# MetlinkWebScraper
Living in the Wairarapa I have a love/hate relationship with the WRL train service which runs between Wellington and Masterton. Usually I don't mind using the train service but when its down for 'maintenance' the service gets replaced by buses. This typically doubles the travel time and is in my opinion a very uncomfortable ride (over a narrow hill road). Fortunately, the metlink website reports these downtimes ahead of time on their website. Unfortunately, this information is not accessible through a user friendly API. Thats where the MetlinkWebScraper comes in, it can extract the service update information for any metlink service for us.
